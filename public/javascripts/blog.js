    "Neurofactor™ provides natural support for your brain. This powerful superfood is derived from whole coffee fruit. For centuries, it was viewed as a waste product until it was finally discovered that it could be used as an eco-friendly way to enhance your health. It contains procyanidins, which are known for their brain-protecting properties. It has clinically shown to significantly increase levels of a key neuroprotein (BDNF), which is important for learning, memory and higher thinking.<br>On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and eves lse he endures pains to avoid worse pains.";

    "Get healthy. Eat better. Feel Good - Everyone on New Year’s Eve. It’s National Green Juice Day! And if you’re anything like us ‘getting healthy, fit and happy’ was on top of your new year’s resolution list. And that’s awesome! Helping people get control of their health is one of the reasons we started Organifi in the first place; our motto is “Inspiration. Education. Empowerment.” There’s no better decision or goal than the one of getting healthy and that’s why we’re so excited about the fact there’s such a thing now as a “National Green Juice Day!” Green. Juice. Day. Let that sink in. We’ve grown so much as a nation, we now champion the power of nutrition - and Green Juice! So much we’re dedicating a day on blogs, social media, and most importantly our lives, to set a reminder in our busy schedule -and make it a goal- to get those mighty greens in our diets for the day. In honor of this quantum leap in mentality, we put together a timeline with a brief history of green juice (that may or may not include some hilarious, yet humbling, beginnings of the Organifi and FitLife family) including all the juicy details -pun totally intended- of how this fantastic day came to be.";

    "It’s Saturday morning, you’re cruising down the fresh vegetable aisle in the supermarket and start loading the cart with carrots, potatoes, celery, broccoli, tomatoes, and then you see it: a white looking carrot - a parsnip. But you leave it behind. After all, you already got carrots and potatoes and what is a parsnip anyway? How do you even cook it? Eat it? Oooh, that dragon fruit looks good. But I digress, poor guy got left behind, and you never got to enjoy the amazing parsnip nutrition benefits we’re about to tell you about! Root vegetables are often overlooked. Because dark leafy greens have a strong reputation for being healthy, and root veggies tend to have a lot of carbs, the latter is often ignored and left out of our plates and blenders in an effort to “eat healthy.” Nothing could be further from the truth! Yes, we love a good green juice reset, but root vegetables and legumes are just as healthy as their cruciferous counterparts; each of nature’s gifts has different flavors, minerals, vitamins, and phytonutrients that are necessary parts of a well-balanced diet. You’d hardly ever hear someone say, “What is broccoli?” But you’ll often hear them say, “What is a parsnip?”";

    "Lemon: Lemons are a staple of many detox diets, and there is good reason for this. Firstly, lemons are packed with antioxidant vitamin C, which is great for the skin and for fighting disease-forming free-radicals. Furthermore, the citrus fruit has an alkaline effect on the body, meaning that it can help restore the body’s pH balance, benefitting the immune system. Try starting your day with hot water and a slice of lemon to help flush out toxins and cleanse your system. Ginger: If too much fatty food or alcohol has caused problems for your digestive system, it may be worthwhile adding some ginger to your diet. Ginger is not only great for reducing feelings of nausea, but it can help improve digestion, beat bloating and reduce gas. In addition to this, ginger is high in antioxidants and is good for boosting the immune system. To give your digestion a helping hand, try sipping on ginger tea or adding some freshly grated ginger to a fruit or vegetable juice. Garlic: Garlic has long been known for its heart benefits, however the pungent food is also good at detoxifying the body. Garlic is not only antiviral, antibacterial and antibiotic, but it contains a chemical called allicin which promotes the production of white blood cells and helps fight against toxins. Garlic is best eaten raw, so add some crushed garlic to a salad dressing to boost its flavour and your health at the same time.";

    "Juicing in general tends to get a bad rap, because while eating a variety of whole fruits and vegetables is essential to a healthy, balanced diet, there isn’t much scientific evidence to show that juicing is better than eating whole foods. In fact, it may be worse. “When you eat whole fruits or vegetables, you’re getting the benefit of the fiber, which helps move food through your system and helps feed the good bacteria in your gut,” Dr. Safdieh explains. When it comes to juice, the fiber content is stripped from its ingredients, and while this still leaves you with important vitamins and minerals, you lose one of the biggest benefits of fruits and veggies. Beyond maintaining a healthy digestive system, fiber helps keep you fuller longer, lower cholesterol, and balance your hormones. That being said, drinking celery juice is certainly safe, just make sure you are getting adequate fiber in your diet in other ways. Dr. Safdieh recommends incorporating whole, plant-based foods, like beans, berries, nuts and seeds, to reach your daily fiber goals. At Parsley Health, we recommend at least 30-40 grams of fiber per day to reap all the benefits. ";
