    Privacy Policy<br><br>

We would rather operate without the need for defined Privacy Policy but unfortunately we have no choice. If there is any term or condition that prevents you from dealing with us, we will look at it, and if reasonable, will confirm in writing its exclusion as part of our agreement.<br><br>

The following Privacy Policy apply to all design and associated services offered by Farm-mart. By ordering services from Farm-mart you are agreeing to the following Privacy Policy.<br><br>

Ethical Issues<br>
We reserve the right to refuse to provide services for a company or associated services which does not accord with our ethical policy or that we judge to be unfit due to content or otherwise. This includes, but is not limited by, companies or sites containing or promoting adult oriented material such as pornography, companies or sites which promote hatred towards persons belonging to any ethnic group, religion or sexual orientation and companies or sites which infringe copyright or are contrary to UK or other relevant national or local laws or regulations.<br><br>

Contract Commencement<br>
The contract between Farm-mart and the client shall consist of the quotation with its specifications and these Privacy Policy.<br><br>

It may not be necessary to have a signature for the contract to commence, verbal communication, email communication or other exchange making it clear that the work specified is required to be carried out shall constitute commencement of the contract and a contractual agreement between the client and Farm-mart shall exist based on the quotation with its specifications and these Privacy Policy.<br><br>

Farm-mart cannot always guarantee to start work immediately on a commission but will arrange a date with the client as to when work can commence. An anticipated finishing date will be agreed and Farm-mart will do its best to adhere to that but cannot guarantee to do so in the light of circumstances outside its control.<br><br>

Where in the instance that a time scale has been agreed, Farm-mart will not be responsible for any consequential losses to the client if the deadline is not met.<br><br>

Design Development Process <br>
When designing graphics or designing for print, Farm-mart will provide a draft of the design by submitting to the client digital prints or Adobe Acrobat PDFs, which the client may view and comment upon the progress. When designing for the internet or stand alone digital media, Farm-mart will provide a draft of the design on its own server during development so that the client may view and comment upon the progress. When the design meets the specifications set out in the quotation with its specifications, Farm-mart will invoice the client for the full amount due.
On receipt of payment, in the case of graphic design or design for print, Farm-mart will provide either the client or the client's specified supplier a CD-ROM disc with all finalised artwork. On receipt of payment, in the case of web design, Farm-mart will publish the website on the client's server, or provide a CD-ROM disc for the client to upload.<br><br>

Where in the instance that a time scale has been agreed, Farm-mart will not be responsible for any consequential losses to the client if the deadline is not met. Farm-mart uses its best endeavours to ensure the website and other services remain functional at all time. However, Farm-mart can not guarantee or warrant that the functions and content of the website or other services will be uninterrupted or error-free. Any problems will be dealt with as speedily as is appropriate to the content and function of the website and may be chargeable at our normal rate during working hours and at double that rate outside normal working hours.<br><br>

Once the design, website and / or other services meet the terms of the quotation with its specifications any modifications to the design will be considered an amendment to the contract. In the absence of a maintenance agreement the time and costs involved in making such changes will be charged to the client.<br><br>

Web Design Standards, Accessibility <br>
Farm-mart makes every effort to design web pages to current web standards and thus display well in the most popular current browsers, but cannot accept responsibility for pages which do not display acceptably in new versions of non-web standard browsers. One version of the website will be created that will display well in all web-standard browsers and at all usual display resolutions.<br><br>

Supply of Content by the Client <br>
The client undertakes to inform us prior to commencement of the project if there is a critical requirement to meet specific performance criteria.<br><br>

If, during the development, the client does not supply the content required in order to complete the commission within the anticipated time frame, Farm-mart will invoice up to the full amount quoted. When the content is supplied there may be additional time costs involved due to the overrun of the project which impinges on the ability of Farm-mart to service other clients.<br><br>

Copyright<br>
All material, both text and images, supplied by the client and used in the construction of the client's project, will remain the client's property. All such material will be assumed to be the property of the client and free to use without fear of breach of copyright laws. The client shall indemnify Farm-mart against all and any claims arising from the use of materials of any sort provided by the client or obtained under the direction of the client from third parties such as graphic designers.<br><br>
The copyright for all material provided by Farm-mart, such as HTML code, graphics, photographs and text, will remain the property of Farm-mart until such time as payment has been made in full. They will then become the property of the client with copyright shared between the client and Farm-mart. This allows either party expeditiously to pursue any copyright infringement. Should the client wish to retain exclusive copyright this shall be arranged but the copyright of Farm-mart shall only be assigned if done so expressly and in writing to the client.<br><br>
Background programming, databases, CGI or JavaScripts produced by Farm-mart remain the intellectual property of Farm-mart unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing. Copyright of any background programming, databases, CGI or JavaScripts remain the property of Farm-mart for the duration of the website's existence and shall not be assigned, modified or reused without the express written permission of Farm-mart. No portion of the coding can be copied, duplicated or redistributed in any form electronic or otherwise unless a licensing agreement has been reached.<br><br>

Testimonial, Reference and Links<br>
Farm-mart retains the right to display graphics and other Web design elements as examples of their work in their respective portfolios. Farm-mart retain the right to refer other prospective clients to your website as testimonial or reference material.<br><br>

Search Engine Submission and Results <br>
Farm-mart will submit a client's website to the major search engines. Further work based on keyword popularity analysis, search engine optimisation based specifically around your organisation and its 'competition' is best carried out by specialist contractors. This can be arranged but is not part of the contract unless specifically included in the quotation. Any subsequent amendments to the website as a result of professional analysis may be charged to the client.<br><br>

Farm-mart can accept no responsibility or liability if any search engine, online directory or search site chooses not to list a client's web site.<br><br>

Payment <br>
Payment terms are strictly 7 days unless otherwise agreed. Whilst any payment due under the agreement remains outstanding, Farm-mart shall be entitled at its sole and absolute discretion to withhold provision of any goods or services it would otherwise be obliged to provide under the agreement. Farm-mart expects payment by cheque, electronic bank transfer, debit/credit card or cash within 7 days of the date on the invoice.<br><br>

Payment may be made in Great British Pound Only. Any payment returned by the bank or credit card company will incur a £10 administration charge in addition to any charges made by the bank. This will be invoiced and will be added to the total outstanding debt owed by the customer.<br><br>

In accordance with the Late Payment of Commercial Debts Act 1998 interest will be charged on all payments received outside of payment terms at the rate of eight per cent above the Bank of England Base Rate as applicable on the previous 31 December or 30 June whichever is the most recent. In case collection proves necessary, the client agrees to pay all fees (including all legal fees and court costs) incurred by that process.<br><br>

If for any reason whatsoever we are unable to provide an agreed product or service in accordance with these Privacy Policy our liability shall be limited in its entirety to a proportional refund of any fees paid by you for the service or product.<br><br>

Website Maintenance <br>
Where Farm-mart undertakes to maintain or update a client's website a system of communication will be established that meets the needs of both the client and of Farm-mart to carry out the maintenance to a service level agreed.<br><br>

Payment for maintenance is usually by monthly fees paid in advance and is reviewed and renewable annually. Where the client cancels a maintenance contract with less than one months' notice, there will be a charge of three months' fees.<br><br>

Where Farm-mart cancels a maintenance contract other than for a reason set out in Cancellation and Termination below, a refund of the fees appropriate to that part of the month remaining will be made.<br><br>

In instances where the client does not come to a web site management agreement it is the sole responsibility of the client to manage the site. Farm-mart will no longer be responsible for the site upon completion unless an alternative agreement has been reached. To assist the operation of a website maintenance contract an email account will be set up in the name of webmaster@yourdomainname.co.uk to allow site visitors to contact Farm-mart directly with technical problems. In the absence of a maintenance agreement, Farm-mart will fix all errors notified to Farm-mart in writing within thirty days of the site being put live on the Internet. If errors are reported after more than thirty days the time and costs involved in making such changes will be charged to the client.<br><br>

Unforeseen and Additional Costs and Expenses
The transfer of domain names to another server can sometimes become a complex and time consuming matter. All administrative fees to third parties and the time taken to organise the transfer will be charged to the client irrespective of any quoted amount set out in the quotation with its specifications.<br><br>

Additional costs incurred in the provision of: stock photography; electronic commerce software; online transaction processing solutions; domain name registration; web space; Internet connection provided by third parties are non refundable.<br><br>

Additional features to websites, including extra database services, specific hosting requirements, animations that are not included in the quotation are subject to surcharge. In the event a feature is required which has not been included in the quotation Farm-mart will give notice prior to implementation and seek acceptance of the surcharge. The cost will be added to the final invoice unless the amount exceeds £500 in which case an interim half will be invoiced before implementation and the remainder will be added to the final invoice.<br><br>

Domain Name Research and Registration<br>
Where the client requests Farm-mart to research and register a domain name the domain name will always be the property and in the control of the client. If, for whatever reason, this is not possible then the client will be informed of the fact. All fees and costs incurred will be payable by the client.<br><br>

Website Hosting Services <br>
Hosting services - where your website is stored on a server for delivery to website visitors - and email services are provided under a contract between the client and the chosen hosting and email provider (Internet Service Provider (ISP)) and will be bound by the Privacy Policy of that ISP.<br><br>

Farm-mart makes no commission on such recommendations or services and in recommending an ISP does so in good faith and cannot under any circumstances be held responsible or liable for any shortcomings or losses incurred as part of that contract.<br><br>

Data Protection<br>
Where the operation of the website or other services provided by Farm-mart involves the collection and administration of personal data the client is deemed to be the Data Controller and as such is responsible for notification under the terms of the Data Protection Acts and related regulations.<br><br>

Farm-mart can arrange the required notification and the current fee for Notification and time and other costs will be payable by the client.<br><br>

The client shall indemnify Farm-mart against any actions, costs and liabilities arising from the use in good faith by Farm-mart of personal data provided by the client or through the client's website / promotional material.<br><br>

Where Project involves e-commerce functionality, the client must ensure that suitable arrangements are in place to maximise security levels with regard to financial and personal information relating to the users of the website and other services. This may necessitate the use of secure electronic protocols, authentication certificates, encryption et cetera and may require the provision of secure server facilities and/or the use of a credit card clearing service.<br><br>
Where a service is provided relating to e-commerce whereby visitors to the client's website can order goods or services through the website - whether through direct or indirect payment the client undertakes to ensure that all transactions are carried out legally and fairly, that the security of personal information and of financial information is maintained and that the collection and control of that data meets the requirements of the Data Protection Acts and regulations.<br><br>

The client is solely responsible for complying with any laws, taxes, and tariffs applicable in any way to the website or any other services contemplated, and will hold harmless, protect, and defend Farm-mart and its sub-contractors from any claim, suit, penalty, tax, fine, or tariff arising from the website or other services provided.<br><br>

Sub-Contracting<br>
If necessary Farm-mart reserves the right, and the client hereby agrees, to allow the use of sub-contractors or agents to work on any aspect of the design or website.<br><br>

Consequential Losses<br>
If for any reason whatsoever Farm-mart is unable to provide an agreed product or service in accordance with these Privacy Policy our liability shall be limited in its entirety to a proportional refund of any fees paid by you for the service or product. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the website or other services is with the client.
